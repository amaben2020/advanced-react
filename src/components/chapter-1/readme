Preventing rerenders by moving state down i.e moving state down to the component that needs it.

Where you put state is very important. Ideally, to avoid future
performance problems, you'd want to isolate it as much as possible to as
tiny and light components as possible.

By removing the state and placing it where absolutely necessary, the heavy components only run once and never rerender
